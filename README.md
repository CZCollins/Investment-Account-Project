# Investment-Account-Project
Project Overview:

The project is an implementation of an InvestmentAccount class in C++ that models a simple investment account. The class includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, adding interest to the balance, and retrieving the current balance.

Problem Being Solved:

The project addresses the need to manage and calculate the balance of an investment account, taking into account deposits, withdrawals, and periodic interest accruals. It provides a simple simulation of account management that can be expanded or integrated into larger financial applications.

Things I Did Well:

The implementation is straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.
Basic input validations are in place for deposits and withdrawals, preventing negative amounts and overdrafts.

Things To Improve:

Introduce more robust error handling for invalid operations to improve reliability.
Ensure that the interest rate is within a valid range (e.g., non-negative).

Challenges:

Handling floating-point arithmetic accurately. Careful consideration of precision and rounding was crucial. Creating proper white space proved to be challenging.

Transferable Skills:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Basic Validation, Handling Financial Calculations.

Making the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable:

Consistent Naming Conventions, Modular Design (Keeping methods small and focused on a single responsibility), Comments and Documentation, Unit Testing.
